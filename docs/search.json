To access a detailed project description, please go to https://emu-hacettepe-analytics.github.io/emu430-fall2024-team-rtistler/\nSummary\n We selected the data set on education levels by province from TÜİK (Turkish Statistical Institute). Our reasons for choosing this data are that it provides access to a large amount of information, making it easier for us to visualize and interpret the data. On the other hand, education is crucial for an individual’s development and is essential for both society and the surrounding environment. As university students, we want to observe the state of education in Turkey through concrete data and draw some conclusions. Our objectives are to analyze the changes in Turkey’s education situation over the years and across provinces, in order to: 1-Identify regions where educational opportunities are lacking. 2-Evaluate whether past policies have been e ective. 3-Develop smart policies to ensure equal access to education. 4-Draw conclusions on how education has impacted our society.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "My first assignment has two parts.\n\n\nI choose the Mustafa Baydoğan’s video.\nSummary: The video generally focuses on data analysis and forecasting, which Mustafa Baydoğan is more interested in. He makes exemplary explanations regarding the predictions and accuracy of the predictions, especially in the fields of timber, electricity and retail. Some of the most important things I remember are that, leaving aside technical things, even if they are areas that you are not interested in, understanding the problem in data analysis is as important as solving it. He explains this and many other important things very well with daily life examples.\nMultiple choice question:\nWhich of the following is not a step in the structured problem solving and data analysis process?\nA)Desicion\nB)Impact\nC)Solution Method\nD)Reaction\nE)Data\nAnswer: D\nOpen-ended question\nDo the predictions given to make a decision have to be absolutely accurate?(Yes or no and please explain it).\nAnswer: No it doesn’t have to be. The more accurate the prediction, the better, but we do not need 100% accuracy to make the right decision. Afterwards, we can make the right decisions with proper optimization.\n\n\n\nFirstly I installed the dslabs.\n\n#install.packages(dslabs)\n\nI opened the dslabs with the library command in my script.\n\nlibrary(dslabs)\n\nSecondly, I use the head(data, first x data set) to show the first 10 row of data set.

At first, I wanted to do it with ifelse, as it was shown in the course slides, but I got an error such as converting characters to numbers in the columns of some data names. Then, although it could be done in other ways, I especially wanted to do it with the for loop, and this way it was more understandable and smooth in my eyes.)\n\n# get the column names in the data set.\ncolumn_names &lt;- names(polls_us_election_2016)\n\n# use for loop to change NA values\nfor (column in column_names) {\n  if (is.numeric(polls_us_election_2016[[column]])) {\n    # change NA values with 2001 for numerical columns\n    polls_us_election_2016[[column]] &lt;- replace(polls_us_election_2016[[column]], is.na(polls_us_election_2016[[column]]), 2001)\n    \n  } else if (is.character(polls_us_election_2016[[column]])) {\n    # change NA values with Emir for character columns\n    polls_us_election_2016[[column]] &lt;- replace(polls_us_election_2016[[column]], is.na(polls_us_election_2016[[column]]), \"Emir\")\n    \n  } else if (is.factor(polls_us_election_2016[[column]])) {\n    # turn the factor columns into character and change NA values with Emir\n    polls_us_election_2016[[column]] &lt;- as.character(polls_us_election_2016[[column]])\n    polls_us_election_2016[[column]] &lt;- replace(polls_us_election_2016[[column]], is.na(polls_us_election_2016[[column]]), \"Emir\")\n    polls_us_election_2016[[column]] &lt;- as.factor(polls_us_election_2016[[column]]) \n  }\n}\n\nFifthly, I head the first 10 row of the data set again.\n\nhead(polls_us_election_2016,10)\n\n        state  startdate    enddate\n1        U.S. 2016-11-03 2016-11-06\n2        U.S. 2016-11-01 2016-11-07\n3        U.S. 2016-11-02 2016-11-06\n4        U.S. 2016-11-04 2016-11-07\n5        U.S. 2016-11-03 2016-11-06\n6        U.S. 2016-11-03 2016-11-06\n7        U.S. 2016-11-02 2016-11-06\n8        U.S. 2016-11-03 2016-11-05\n9  New Mexico 2016-11-06 2016-11-06\n10       U.S. 2016-11-04 2016-11-07\n                                                     pollster grade samplesize\n1                                    ABC News/Washington Post    A+       2220\n2                                     Google Consumer Surveys     B      26574\n3                                                       Ipsos    A-       2195\n4                                                      YouGov     B       3677\n5                                            Gravis Marketing    B-      16639\n6  Fox News/Anderson Robbins Research/Shaw & Company Research     A       1295\n7                                     CBS News/New York Times    A-       1426\n8                                NBC News/Wall Street Journal    A-       1282\n9                                                    Zia Poll  Emir       8439\n10                                                   IBD/TIPP    A-       1107\n   population rawpoll_clinton rawpoll_trump rawpoll_johnson rawpoll_mcmullin\n1          lv           47.00         43.00            4.00             2001\n2          lv           38.03         35.69            5.46             2001\n3          lv           42.00         39.00            6.00             2001\n4          lv           45.00         41.00            5.00             2001\n5          rv           47.00         43.00            3.00             2001\n6          lv           48.00         44.00            3.00             2001\n7          lv           45.00         41.00            5.00             2001\n8          lv           44.00         40.00            6.00             2001\n9          lv           46.00         44.00            6.00             2001\n10         lv           41.20         42.70            7.10             2001\n   adjpoll_clinton adjpoll_trump adjpoll_johnson adjpoll_mcmullin\n1         45.20163      41.72430        4.626221             2001\n2         43.34557      41.21439        5.175792             2001\n3         42.02638      38.81620        6.844734             2001\n4         45.65676      40.92004        6.069454             2001\n5         46.84089      42.33184        3.726098             2001\n6         49.02208      43.95631        3.057876             2001\n7         45.11649      40.92722        4.341786             2001\n8         43.58576      40.77325        5.365788             2001\n9         44.82594      41.59978        7.870127             2001\n10        42.92745      42.23545        6.316175             2001",

    "text": "I choose the Mustafa Baydoğan’s video.\nSummary: The video generally focuses on data analysis and forecasting, which Mustafa Baydoğan is more interested in. He makes exemplary explanations regarding the predictions and accuracy of the predictions, especially in the fields of timber, electricity and retail. Some of the most important things I remember are that, leaving aside technical things, even if they are areas that you are not interested in, understanding the problem in data analysis is as important as solving it. He explains this and many other important things very well with daily life examples.\nMultiple choice question:\nWhich of the following is not a step in the structured problem solving and data analysis process?\nA)Desicion\nB)Impact\nC)Solution Method\nD)Reaction\nE)Data\nAnswer: D\nOpen-ended question\nDo the predictions given to make a decision have to be absolutely accurate?(Yes or no and please explain it).\nAnswer: No it doesn’t have to be. The more accurate the prediction, the better, but we do not need 100% accuracy to make the right decision. Afterwards, we can make the right decisions with proper optimization.",
